Learning GitHub for work
I'm learning GitHub in conjunction with VisualStudio 2019 and Eclipse at work, and, well, I'm slow to pick it up. There are so many moving parts that make grasping basic mastery more than burdensome. 

You can only develop here...
Here's how you get the latest...
Committ, but don't push yet...
You staged your committs in the wrong branch...

These are just a few of the problems I've run into. I need to learn, and I need to learn now.
